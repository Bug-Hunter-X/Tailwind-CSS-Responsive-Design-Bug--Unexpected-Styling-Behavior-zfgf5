# Tailwind CSS Responsive Design Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug related to unexpected styling behavior in Tailwind CSS when working with complex responsive designs. The bug causes styles to not apply correctly or to be applied unexpectedly at various breakpoints, even when the Tailwind classes seem correctly implemented.

## Bug Description

The bug manifests as unpredictable styling issues across different screen sizes. Tailwind directives may not produce their expected visual outcome.  The core problem stems from specificity conflicts between different styles or incorrect class ordering, which can override or unexpectedly interfere with other classes.

## Reproduction

The `bug.html` file contains the example code exhibiting the problem.  The layout is intended to transition to a two-column grid at medium screen sizes.  The issue occurs when certain other styles are added (as in this case, with a parent container), or classes are added in a way that changes their specificity, resulting in the grid not rendering appropriately at the expected breakpoints.

## Solution

The solution is found in `bugSolution.html`. To fix the issue, we need to address the specificity conflicts with more specific selectors (i.e., using `!important` where absolutely necessary or better organized styles) or using the `@layer` directives to manage the order of CSS rule declarations. This ensures the intended Tailwind styles override conflicting styles and apply correctly.
